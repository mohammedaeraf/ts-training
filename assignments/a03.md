# 📘 **Assignment 03**

## 🎯 **Objective:**

Apply your understanding of **TypeScript classes** by creating and using class-based objects and methods.

---

## 📝 **Tasks:**

---

### 🔹 Q1: Create a class `Book`

Define a class `Book` with:

- Properties:
  `title: string`, `author: string`, `publishedYear: number`, `summary: string`

- A constructor to initialize all properties

- A method `printDetails()` that prints:

  ```
  Book: <title> by <author> (<publishedYear>)
  Summary: <summary>
  ```

Create **two objects** of the `Book` class and call their `printDetails()` methods.

---

### 🔹 Q2: Create a class `Student`

Define a class `Student` with:

- Properties:
  `name: string`, `age: number`, `grade: string`

- A constructor to initialize all values

- A method `displayInfo()` that prints:

  ```
  Student: <name>, Age: <age>, Grade: <grade>
  ```

Create **two student objects** and call their `displayInfo()` methods.

---

### 🔹 Q3 (Bonus): Create a class `Circle`

- Properties:
  `radius: number`

- Constructor to initialize radius

- Method `calculateArea()` to return area of the circle using formula
  [
  Area = \pi \times radius^2
  ]

- Print the area rounded to two decimal places.

---

## ✨ Example Output

```ts
Book: The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho (1988)
Summary: A story about following dreams.

Student: Aisha, Age: 16, Grade: A
Student: Rahul, Age: 15, Grade: B+

Circle with radius 5 → Area: 78.54
```
